# SlayTheDragon
A game I made during my senior year of high school.

## How to Play:
- The Player is mapped to the mouse, click to fire!
- Destory the minions of the Dragon before they can touch and hurt you
- Once the cat meter fills up, The Dragon will appear
- Dodge the dragon's fire and end his life with your fury!

## Supported OS:
- Windows 7/8/10
